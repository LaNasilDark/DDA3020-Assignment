    "# 🌳 Homework: Programming Tree-Based Models\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 Core Idea & Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a complete, hands-on pipeline for building, evaluating, and optimizing a decision tree classifier. The goal is to move beyond just calling `.fit()` and `.predict()` and to deeply understand the *process* of model tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the \"Adult\" (Census) dataset, a classic classification task to predict whether an individual's income is greater than $50K/year.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our pipeline will cover:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Environment Setup:** Downloading the data and setting up reproducible hyperparameters.\n",
    "2.  **Data Preprocessing:** This is a crucial and realistic step. We will load messy, real-world data and transform it into a clean, numerical format suitable for `scikit-learn`. This includes:\n",
    "      * Handling missing values (marked as `?`).\n",
    "      * Cleaning inconsistent data (the test set has artifacts).\n",
    "      * Performing **One-Hot Encoding** for categorical features.\n",
    "      * Splitting data into **three** distinct sets: **Train, Validation, and Test**.\n",
    "3.  **Baseline Modeling:** We'll build a standard, unpruned decision tree to establish a \"baseline\" performance. We expect this model to be complex and to **overfit**.\n",
    "4.  **Model Optimization (Pruning):** We'll use **Cost-Complexity Pruning (CCP)**, a robust method for finding a simpler, more generalizable tree. This is the core of the exercise:\n",
    "      * We will use the **Training set** to *build* the trees.\n",
    "      * We will use the **Validation set** to *select the best pruning hyperparameter (`ccp_alpha`)*.\n",
    "      * We will (finally) use the **Test set** to *report the final, unbiased performance* of our chosen model.\n",
    "5.  **Advanced Exploration:** We will investigate the `max_features` hyperparameter, which forms the basis of the **Random Forest** algorithm, to see how feature randomization affects model performance and structure.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Motivation:** This is the data engineering phase. Real-world data is never clean. We must load the data and transform it into a numerical feature matrix `X` and a target vector `y`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Load:** Read the CSVs using `pandas`. We must specify `sep=', '`, `na_values=' ?'`, and `skiprows=1` (for the test file) to handle the dataset's quirks.\n",
    "2.  **Sample:** Use `.sample()` to grab a small, random subset, using our `RANDOM_SEED`.\n",
    "3.  **Combine:** We **temporarily combine** the train and test sets. This is a critical step to ensure that `pd.get_dummies` (One-Hot Encoding) sees all possible categories from *both* sets, preventing a \"mismatched columns\" error later.\n",
    "4.  **Clean:**\n",
    "      * `dropna()`: A simple strategy to handle missing values (marked as `?`).\n",
    "      * `.str.replace('.', ...)`: The test set's target variable has an extra period (e.g., `<=50K.`). We must remove it.\n",
    "      * `.map(...)`: Convert the string target (`<=50K`) into a binary integer (`0` or `1`).\n",
    "5.  **Encode:** Use `pd.get_dummies` to convert categorical columns (like 'workclass', 'occupation') into many binary (0/1) columns. `drop_first=True` is used to prevent perfect multicollinearity.\n",
    "6.  **Split:** We split the data back into `train` and `test`. Then, we split the `train` data *again* into `X_train` and `X_val`. This gives us our three distinct sets."

As a result, the model is expected to exhibit high complexity, achieving perfect or near-perfect performance on the training dataset. However, such behavior typically indicates **overfitting**, where the model memorizes noise and idiosyncrasies in the training data, leading to poor generalization on unseen test data. The resulting test accuracy of this baseline model will serve as a benchmark for subsequent model improvements.\n",
